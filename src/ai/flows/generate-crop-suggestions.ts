 * @fileOverview This file defines a Genkit flow for generating crop suggestions based on farm data and market demand.
 *
 * The flow takes farm-specific data (soil type, location, weather data link, pH, moisture, nutrient content) and
 * market demand as input, and uses an AI model to generate tailored crop suggestions. It uses a tool to fetch live market data.
 *
 * @function generateCropSuggestions - The exported function that triggers the flow.

  prompt: `You are an AI assistant designed to provide crop suggestions to farmers based on their farm's specific conditions and current market demands.

  Use the 'getMarketData' tool to fetch the latest market prices for the farm's location to help your decision.

  Consider the following information about the farm:
  - Soil Type: {{{soilType}}}
  - Location: {{{location}}}
  - Weather Data Link: {{{weatherDataLink}}}
  - pH Level: {{{pH}}}
  - Moisture Content: {{{moistureContent}}}
  - Nutrient Content: {{{nutrientContent}}}
  - Temperature: {{{temperature}}}Â°C
  - Past Crop Rotation Data: {{{pastCropRotationData}}}
  - Weather Forecast: {{{weatherForecast}}}

  Considering the current market demand: {{{marketDemand}}}, suggest the most suitable crops for the farmer to plant. 
  For each crop, provide the following details:
  - cropName: The name of the crop.
  - yieldForecast: The estimated yield in an appropriate unit (e.g., quintals/acre).
  - profitMargin: An estimated profit margin percentage.
  - sustainabilityScore: A score from 0 to 100 representing how sustainable the crop is for the given conditions (considering water usage, soil health impact, etc.).
  
  Also, provide a short, overall explanation of your reasoning for the suggestions.
  Ensure the crop suggestions are provided in an array of objects.
