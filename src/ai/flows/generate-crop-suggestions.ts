  Consider the following information about the farm:
  - Soil Type: {{{soilType}}}
  - Location: {{{location}}}
  - Weather Data Link: {{{weatherDataLink}}}
  - pH Level: {{{pH}}}
  - Moisture Content: {{{moistureContent}}}
  - Nutrient Content: {{{nutrientContent}}}
  - Temperature: {{{temperature}}}Â°C
  - Past Crop Rotation Data: {{{pastCropRotationData}}}
  - Weather Forecast: {{{weatherForecast}}}
  - Market Prices: {{{marketPrices}}}

  Considering the current market demand: {{{marketDemand}}}, suggest the most suitable crops for the farmer to plant. 
  For each crop, provide the following details:
  - cropName: The name of the crop.
  - yieldForecast: The estimated yield in an appropriate unit (e.g., quintals/acre).
  - profitMargin: An estimated profit margin percentage.
  - sustainabilityScore: A score from 0 to 100 representing how sustainable the crop is for the given conditions (considering water usage, soil health impact, etc.).
  
  Also, provide a short, overall explanation of your reasoning for the suggestions.
  Ensure the crop suggestions are provided in an array of objects.
