## üîÑ Workflow  

1. Farmer logs in via Firebase Auth.  
2. Inputs soil details + uploads crop image.  
3. Backend fetches soil, weather, and market data.  
4. AI Engine:  
   - Recommends best crops with yield & profit.  
   - Detects diseases from uploaded images.  
5. Advisory system translates results into local languages.  
6. Farmer receives results + treatment + market insights.  
7. Notifications alert about rainfall, pest outbreaks, or price changes.  
8. Offline support queues disease analysis & financial transactions in localStorage, syncing them when internet returns.

## üì¶ Offline Support  

- **Queued Actions in LocalStorage**: Disease analysis & financial transactions stored locally when offline.  
- **Auto-Sync on Reconnect**: Actions automatically synced with Firebase when internet returns.  
- **Service Worker**: Handles caching & background sync for offline reliability.

## üìä Datasets & Research Sources  

- [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) ‚Äì Crop & disease datasets  
- [ICAR](https://icar.org.in) ‚Äì Indian Council of Agricultural Research  
- [FAO](https://www.fao.org) ‚Äì Food and Agriculture Organization  

**Usage:**  
Datasets are used for AI model training (crop recommendation & disease detection). Market and weather data are fetched in real-time via APIs.  

---

## üí° Unique Value Proposition (UVP)  

- Offline support with background sync  
- AI-driven disease detection from images  
- Integrated financial tracking & profit calculation  
- Localized language advisory system  
- Real-time weather + market alerts

## üì∏ Example User Flow  

1. Farmer logs in.  
2. Inputs soil data and uploads a crop image.  
3. AI engine processes and provides:  
   - Best crops + profit estimate.  
   - Detected disease with treatment.  
4. Results are displayed in farmer‚Äôs local language.  
5. Farmer tracks expenses & profits.  
6. Alerts sent for weather, pests, and market price changes.
